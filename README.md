## Build Instructions

Download and install Lazarus **version 2.0.0** from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/files/Lazarus%20Windows%2064%20bits/)

Run Lazarus and click on `Project->Open Project`.  Select
`cheatengine.lpi` from the `Cheat Engine` folder as the project.

Click on `Run->Build` or use <kbd>SHIFT+F9</kbd>.

If you want to run or debug from the IDE on Windows you will need to start
Lazarus as administrator.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute, fork the repository on github.  Create a branch
for your changes.  Lazarus likes to make changes to files just when you open
them or move something around, so make sure you only stage the changes that
are required for what you are trying to accomplish.

When you're done, push your branch to your personal fork.  Finally go to the
original Cheat Engine repository and create a pull request.  Click on
'compare across forks' and select your fork as the head fork and your new
branch.
